# diabetic-retinopathy-detection
DR is detected by the appearance of different types of lesions on a retina image. These lesions are microaneurysms (MA), haemorrhages (HM), soft and hard exudates (EX) [1,6,7]. Microaneurysms (MA) is the earliest sign of DR that appears as small red round dots on the retina due to the weakness of the vessel's walls.
